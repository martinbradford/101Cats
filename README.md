# 101Cats
This is the distribution point for 101Cats deliverables. It will typically contain a zip file called "setup.zip" and one or more documents giving installation instructions and release notes.
No source code is included here. The source code is stored in a private GitHub repository which is made available to interested parties subject to some rules. Ping me a message if you want access.

Please note that this software is distributed free of charge and with absolutely no guarantee at all. I developed it for my own use and there are a number of active users. I do try to fix bugs though I accept no commitment to do so. If you find a bug or have a suggestion for an improvement, please raise an issue or start a discussion thread. 

When I've worked out how to configure it, this repository will be published in a controlled manner as "www.101cats.co.uk"

The installation image for the latest version of the application can be obtained via the following link https://github.com/martinbradford/101Cats/blob/main/setup(1.0.9.0).zip
