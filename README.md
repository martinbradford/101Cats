# 101Cats
This is the distribution point for 101Cats deliverables. It will typically contain a zip file called "setup.zip" and one or more documents giving installation instructions and release notes.
No source code is included here. The source code is stored in a private GitHub repository which is made available to interested parties subject to some rules. Ping me a message if you want access.

Please note that this software is distributed free of charge and with absolutely no guarantee at all. I developed it for my own use and there are a number of active users. I do try to fix bugs though I accept no commitment to do so. If you find a bug or have a suggestion for an improvement, please raise an issue or start a discussion thread. 

When I've worked out how to configure it, this repository will be published in a controlled manner as "www.101cats.co.uk"

The installation image for the latest version of the application can be obtained via the following [link](https://github.com/martinbradford/101Cats/blob/main/setup1.0.9.9.zip).

A Wiki is slowly under construction - follow this [link](https://github.com/martinbradford/101Cats/wiki) for access. At the moment, edit access to the wiki is limited to registered collaborators - if you are willing and able to contribute, ping me a message to ask to be added to the collaborators list.  Use this [link](mailto:one.oh.onecats@outlook.com) to address me.

## Configuration

101Cats will need to be configured to match your setup. There are a lot of configuration options and, if you are running several external applications or using additional hardware, the configuration can be quite complex. The configuration is stored in an XML file in your AppData directory. 101Cats includes a dialogue box that allows you to configure the more common options, but it is also sometimes necessary to edit the file directly. There are some (slightly) more detailed instructions in the Wiki...
