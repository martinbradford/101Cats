This is the distribution point for 101Cats deliverables. It will typically contain a zip file called "setup.zip" and one or more documents giving installation instructions and release notes.
No source code is included here. The source code is stored in a private GitHub repository which is made available to interested parties subject to some rules. Ping me a message if you want access.

**101Cats** is a CAT control program written specifically for the Yaesu FTdx101 series of radios. These are complex radios with many functions and controls. The author had been a long-time user of other CAT programs including HRD and Win4Yaesu - both very competent pieces of software - but when I upgraded to the FTdx101D, I came to the conclusion that there was no generic CAT application that could really do it justice, so I started to write my own. That has developed into 101Cats.

Please note that this software is distributed free of charge and with absolutely no guarantee at all. I developed it for my own use and there are a number of active users. I do try to fix bugs though I accept no commitment to do so. If you find a bug or have a suggestion for an improvement, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/martinbradford/101Cats/issues) or start a [discussion thread](https://github.com/martinbradford/101Cats/discussions). 

The installation image for the latest version (1.0.9.7) of the application can be obtained via the following [link](https://github.com/martinbradford/101Cats/raw/main/setup(1.0.9.7).zip) .

Version 1.0.9.7 fixes several bugs and introduces some new features:

- Frequencies can be entered through the keyboard. If the Keypad dialogue is displayed, then pressing any numeric key, the period key, the backspace key or the enter key has the same effect as clicking the corresponding button. If the Keypad dialogue box is not open, then pressing any numeric key while the main window has focus will open the Keypad dialogue box and enter the corresponding digit.
- The configuration dialogue box has been tidied up. The number of controls had grown beyond what could reasonably be displayed on a single screen, so it has now been converted into a tabbed format. New tabs will be added over time to cover further configuration options.
- The Modulation Sources dialogue box is now fully live. It is opened with the "Modulation Sources" button in the lower pane.
